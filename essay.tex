\section{Proposal}
The games industry is filled with small DLC and microtransactions, these are designed to enhance the gameplay experience of the player by adding or unlocking content. In recent years however microtransactions have started to adapt a loot box system which allows players to pay a small amount to unlock boxes with various game items or cosmetics. A study done by NPD shows that the largest number of purchases are for Weapons/tools for use in-game. 

Many of these microtransactions however are now being introduced to maximize the amount that people will spend on these transactions.
